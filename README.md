# CORD_-certain-overspeed-reduction-device-
## An IoT solution for over-speed reduction

1. Clone repository using `git clone git@github.com:PSYCHOBITx/CORD_-certain-overspeed-reduction-device-.git`

## Requirements to try this project
- Knowledge of Arduino hardware
- Arduino (any variant)
- RF module for Arduino
- Arduino IDE

> Don't worry if you don't have any of the above listed requirements, U can still explore the algorithm by executing simple message queue codes present in directory, but yeah! that will not be IoT anymore :stuck_out_tongue: , it's provided to just get the logic that at core how it works.
